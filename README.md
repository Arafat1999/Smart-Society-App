#Introduction
Purpose:
The current system of maintaining housing society requires tremendous
man power, time and human interaction. For example: notifying
members about power shedding, water shortage, bill payment for
maintenance requires human interaction. Given the current situation
of COVID19 such interaction is to be avoided. Apart from the pandemic
situation the usual methods of maintenance of a society are still
cost inefficient,time consuming,demand more labour and lack transparency
between society members and management. In the terms of
expenditure,expenses on stationary such as paper,printer,ink for the
printing of notices,receipts etc. Time consuming in the terms of personally
writing checks,payment through cash. Demand more labour
in terms of an individual is tasked to collect checks and cash for maintenance
and record keeping another individual is tasked to deliver receipts
and notices to individual apartment. Lack of transparency between
society members and management in terms of lack of up-to-date
recording keeping of finances used for maintaining housing society,
reduces transparency as there is usually one annual report of finances.
It can also be inefficient due to delay in addressing of complaints and
grievances due to varied reasons.

#Project Scope:
• This application will overcome the drawbacks of maintaining housing
societies via traditional methods.
• Time efficient in terms of users will be able to pay maintenance
bill from any place -any time, quick delivery of information by
uploading notices on the app and early redressal of complaint(s).
• Cost effectiveness by reduced use of stationary.
• Reduced effort as members will not be required to personally
deposit cash/cheque(s) for maintenance and personnel to handdeliver
notices.
• Increased transparency between society members and management
as financial transactions for maintenance of the society will
be regularly updated.

#Project Goals and Objectives:
Goals:
• Online Maintenance Payment will avoid human interaction and
give the liberty to pay from any where and any time with ease.
User can pay maintenance bill through online payment methods
like Google Pay, Paytm, PhonePe, etc.
• Complaints feature will result in quick redressal, making it more
efficient. Users can register complaints by specifying the level of
critical, category and describing the issue. Where as admin (committee
member) can resolve the complaints and mark the complaints
status accordingly. Users can track the complaints status
as well.
• Updates of notices will reduce man power, making it cost efficient
and reducing human interaction. Users can view the notices,
where as admin can add notices.
•Contact information about important individuals such as committee
members, security guards will help in quick redressals.

#Objectives:
The objectives of creating an app to develop a new system that is time
efficient, cost effective, reduces manual labour and increases the transparency.
This will be achieved through the following points:
• Time efficiency.
• Cost effectiveness.
• Reduced labour.
